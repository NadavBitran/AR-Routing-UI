# AR Routing UI

Welcome to the AR Routing UI project! This project is a React-based user interface that allows the user to manage his/her **Routes and Steps**, while communicates relevant data to the larger AR project. It is designed to work alongside the [AR project](https://github.com/KapGames/AR-Team "Link to AR project"), which is being collaboratively developed by multiple teams, including us.
